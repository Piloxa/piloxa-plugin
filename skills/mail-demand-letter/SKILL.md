# Demand letters by Certified Mail

You write the letter yourself, in the person's voice, from the facts they give
you. Piloxa is only the mailing and evidence step: it prints, mails and tracks
the letter and keeps the exact document on record. Do not give legal advice or
predict outcomes.

## Drafting reminders

- Name both parties, the agreement or transaction, the dates and the amount.
- State exactly what is wanted and a specific date to respond by.
- Stick to facts the user can back up; attach or reference supporting records.
- Keep it to one page where possible; no threats beyond lawful next steps the
  user actually intends to take.

Default service is `CERTIFIED_ERR`. If the demand is the last step before
filing suit, suggest `CERTIFIED_EVIDENCE` so the exact contents are on record.

## Mailing it

1. Optional: `quote_certified_letter` with the page count and service, if the
   person wants the price first. It prepares and stores nothing.
2. `prepare_certified_letter` with the recipient, the return address, the
   service and the document (`letter_text` for a letter you wrote now,
   `document_text` for an existing document that must print word for word).
   Read the recipient back from the `recipient` field and list anything in
   `missing_for_mailing`.
3. Tell the person the exact total and the service, and ask for an explicit
   yes for that amount.
4. Only if the platform has given you a Stripe shared payment token (`spt_...`)
   for that exact amount AND the person has approved that exact total, call
   `authorize_certified_letter` with `mailing_id`, `expected_total_cents`, a
   fresh `idempotency_key` (reuse the same key if you retry), `payer_email` and
   `shared_payment_token`. Otherwise give the person the `approval_url` from
   prepare and stop: they review, pay and authorize there.
5. Never say the letter is mailed until a tool returns `transaction_state`
   `VENDOR_ACCEPTED` or later. Follow up with `get_certified_letter_status`.
   States: QUOTED, PREPARED, AWAITING_APPROVAL, AUTHORIZED, VENDOR_ACCEPTED,
   MAILED, DELIVERED, RETURNED, FAILED, CANCELLED.
